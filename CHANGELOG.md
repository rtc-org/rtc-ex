## v0.2.0 - 2024-08-07

This version upgrades to RDF.ex v2.0.

### Added 

- `RTC.Compound.change_graph_name/1` which changes the graph name that will be 
  used in serializations to RDF (as opposed to `change_name/1` which, as an
  alias of `reset_id/1`, also changes the id of the compound itself)
